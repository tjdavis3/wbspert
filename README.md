# wbspert

Simple program to generate the following from a CSV:

+ PERT Chart (PlantUML)
+ Work Breakdown Structure (PlantUML)
+ Work Breakdown Table (Markdown)

The input spreadsheet is expected to look like this:

| Task | Title | Parents | Duration |
| --- | ---- | ------- | -------- |
| 1.1 | Virtual Directories | 1.1.2 | 1 |
| 1.1.2 | Map all customer under FTP login |  | 2 |
| 2.1 | Create virtual directory for each account | 1.1.2, 1.1 | 1 |
| 3 | SFTPGO for FTP Service | 2.1 | 3 |

This table would generate

**WBS**

```plantuml
@startwbs
* Project
** 1.1: Virtual Directories
*** 1.1.2: Map all customer under FTP login
** 2.1: Create virtual directory for each account
** 3: SFTPGO for FTP Service
@endwbs
```

**PERT**

```plantuml
@startuml PERT
left to right direction
map Start {
}

map "1.1: Virtual Directories" as 1.1 {
	Duration => 1
}

map "1.1.2: Map all customer under FTP login" as 1.1.2 {
	Duration => 2
}

map "2.1: Create virtual directory for each account" as 2.1 {
	Duration => 1
}

map "3: SFTPGO for FTP Service" as 3 {
	Duration => 3
}
1.1.2 --> 1.1
Start --> 1.1.2
1.1.2 --> 2.1
1.1 --> 2.1
2.1 --> 3
